This is project visualize: 4 common path finding algorithms.

Dijkstra: weighted search, guarantee shortest path.

A star: weighted searh, does not guarantee shortest path. However, it tend to be more efficient.

Breath-first search: unweighted search, guarantee shortest path (unweighted search only).

Depth-first search: unweighted search, does not guarantee shortest path. Have various applications: topoplogy sort, find strongly connected components.
